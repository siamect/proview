/**
 * Attribute reference.
 * <p>
 * Basic type attribute reference. Reference to an attribute in an object. The reference 
 * contains 
 * <li>- objid of the referenced object 
 * <li>- classid of body 
 * <li>- offset of the attribute 
 * <li>- size of the attribute 
 * <li>- a flagword. 
 * <p>
 * If the bit Indirect is set, the attribute is a pointer. The string notation for an attrref 
 * is _A'vid':'oix'('classvolume':'class').'attribute'[index], e.g.
 * _A0.123.34.63:1234567890(pwrb:Ai).FilterAttribute[2] or if the class is unknown, the notation 
 * is _A'vid':'oix'('cid').('bix')'offset'.'size', e.g. _A0.123.34.63.1234567890(_C0.1:34).(_B1)60.34 
 * where vid is the volume id for the object. oix is the object index for the object. cid is 
 * classid for the class of the object. bix is body index for the body of the attribute.
