/* This class is used as a ComponentListener for any Component for which
 the Aspect Ratio is important and needs to be retained. The constructor
needs to know what Component it is applied to and the original size of it.
From the size the aspect ratio is calculated and every time the Container
is resized. The size is changed so that the aspect ratio matches the, 
relatively, smaller one of the new width and height.
