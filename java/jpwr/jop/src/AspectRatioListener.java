/**
   Component listener that retains the aspect ratio.
   <p>
   This class is used as a ComponentListener for any Component for which
   the Aspect Ratio is important and needs to be retained. The constructor
   needs to know what Component it is applied to and the original size of it.
   From the size the aspect ratio is calculated and every time the Container
   is resized. The size is changed so that the aspect ratio matches the, 
   relatively, smaller one of the new width and height.
   syntax : new AspectTarioListener(c) or new AspectRatioListener(c,size)
   where c is the component, and size is the original size of it.
