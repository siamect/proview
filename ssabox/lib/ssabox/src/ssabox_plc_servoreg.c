* Description   : Contains main functions for anti-sway control,
*               : called from plc
*
*               Date    Sign           Action
* Revision      050213  jonas_h        First edition
*               050721  jonas_h        Improved error handling: Errors are
*written to an internal buffer instead of being printed with printf(..). From
*the buffer, errors are stored in a String80 output, that can be connected e.g.
*to a DSup.
*                                      Extended functionality for automatic
*object: The soft maximum velocity, umaxS, can be changed while in travel (if
*e.g. in a low-speed area).
*                                      Transfer of set to manual object when
*disabling, allowing for continued anti-sway, and smooth travel.
