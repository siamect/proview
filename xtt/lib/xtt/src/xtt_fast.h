//! Window that displays fast curve in a DsFastCurve object.
/*!
  A DsFastCurve references a data array for the time axis, and up to 10 data arrays
  with stored data. These arrays are displayed in the XttFast window. The measurement
  of these curves are triggered manually, on a digital signal, or on a level of one of
  the attributes. When the measurement is completed this is signaled with the New attribute
  in the DsFastCurve object. The XttFast window then has to read the new data and
  reconfigure the curves. XttFast uses the GeCurve class to display the curves.
