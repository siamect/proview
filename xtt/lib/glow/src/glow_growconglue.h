/*! A GrowConGlue object is an object that is either the endpoint for a connection, or a connection object
  between a number of connections. The GrowConGlue has four connectionpoints in the directions left, right,
  up and down. The shape of the object is adjusted after the size, color and shadow of the connections.

  The GrowConGlue class contains function for drawing the object, and handle events when the 
  object is clicked on, moved etc.
