Profinet Viewer

The Profinet Viewer dispays a list of the current devices one the Profinet circuit.
It is also possible to set the name and ip address to a device. 

<h1>Set devicename and ip address
When a device is exchanged the devicename of the old device has to be set to the new device.
In some cases the ip address has to be set as well. Also when a device is configured for the 
first time, the device name and ip address has to be set on the device.

The steps to set the devicename and ip address is:

- Stop Proview runtime environment on the current node.
- Start the Profinet Viewer.
- Find the new device in the list of devices.
- Open the device and enter the new name i DeviceName, by selecting DeviceName and press
  the Arrow Right Key. An input field is opened where the new name is entered.
- Enter a new ip address by selecting Ip Address and press the Arrow Right Key. An input field 
  is opened where the new address is entered.
- Select the device and activate Function/Set Device Properties in the menu. Now the 
  new name and ip address is transfered to the node.
- Activate Functions/Update to update the list and check the settings of the new device.
