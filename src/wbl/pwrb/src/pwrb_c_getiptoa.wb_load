!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_macro_io.h
!  @Group Plc,PlcIO
!  @Summary Get integer attribute and convert to analog value
!  Get Integer parameter and convert to analog value.
!  @image orm_getiptoa_fo.gif
!
!  Fetches the value of a 32-, 16- or 8-bits integer
!  parameter in arbitrary object.
!  
!  The complete name of the attribute has to be supplied.
!
! @b Example
!  In the example below the value of the integer parameter, AccMod is stored: 
!
!  - unconditionally by StoAtoIp 
!  - conditionally by CStoAtoIp 
!
!  The value is also unconditionally stored as a pwr_tFloat32 on an attribute 
!  pwr_tFloat32 in the object named TIC2M
