!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_macro_div.h
!  Graphical PLC objects are configured in windows. All
!  objects in such a window gets a쟙indowPlc object as
!  parent object.
!  
!  The object is configured automatically, by the
!  development environment, direct below a,
!    PlcPgm object when the PLC Editor creates the
!     corresponding 'PLC window' at first time.
!  
!    CSub object when the corresponding sub-window is
!     opened at first time.
!  
!      Hints
!  Notice the possibility at module check to switch the
!  execution of individual modules off. This may be one
!  way to locate, for instance, which module among others
!  that all the time writes a certain value.
