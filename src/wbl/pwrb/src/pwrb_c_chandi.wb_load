!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group IO,Channels,NodeConfiguration
!  @Summary Configures a digital input channel
!   Configures a digital input channel independent of the
!   type of physical Di-card.
!  
!   Figure below shows the steps in Di-signal conversion and the 
!   attributes of interest. The internal filtering concerns local
!   Di-signals, i.e. remote Di-signals are not affected.
!   @image orm_en1-34.gif
!   Attributes Used in Di-signal Conversion
!
!   ActualValue and FilterType belongs to Di object.
!   InvMask1 and ConvMask1 to card object, but InvertOn and
!   ConversionOn belongs to this object.
!  
! @b Hints  
!  ChanDi objects are configured below a suitable Di-card
!  object.
!  Rack and card objects to different I/O systems are
!  documented separately.
!  
!  To create card object with channel objects belonging to
!  it the function 'Configure Card' in "Utility Window" is
!  recommended.
