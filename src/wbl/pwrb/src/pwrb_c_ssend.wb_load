!  The object remains active until its SubStep object
!  becomes active. See figure 3-50.
!  The object sets Order[1]= TRUE in its parent, i.e. the
!  current SubStep object.
!  
!  To the right output one or more Order objects can be
!  connected at the same time as well as one or more Stoxx,
!  Setxx or Resxx objects. The output can also be left
!  open or be used as an ordinary binary signal.
