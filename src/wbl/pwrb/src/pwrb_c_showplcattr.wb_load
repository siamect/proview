!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group Plc,PlcEdit
!  @Summary Object to display the value of some PLC attributes
!  Object to display the value of some important PLC
!  program attributes.
!  @image orm_en1-200.gif
!
!  ShowPlcAttr object is, for instance, configured in one
!  of the Document objects in a PLC program.
!  
!  The object is not dynamic. If the 'node name' or the
!  cycle time are changed by the Attribute Editor the new
!  values will not be shown in an existing ShowPlcAttr
!  object. To display the new values it is necessary to
!  delete the ShowPlcAttr object and then create a new
!  one!
!  ResetObject may, opposite to the name of the $Node
!  object and the cycle time, be specified direct in the
!  ShowPlcAttr object.
!  
! @b Hints
!  Create a ShowPlcAttr object in some of the Document
!  objects in the PLC program, e.g. the first one. Then
!  will the transcriptions of the PLC program contain
!  information about 'node name', cycle time and reset
!  object.
