!/**

!  @Group Servers,NodeConfiguration
!  @Summary Configuration of DsFast process
!  Specifies attributes of a single DsFast.
!  
!  In every node where fast graphs should be stored there
!  has to be a DsFast job to search through the local
!  DsFast objects.
!  @image orm_en1-67.gif
!
! @b Hints
!  The DsFastConf object is placed below the $Node object.
!  If a Ds_Fast job is loaded to a node, which has no
!  DsFastConf object, it will execute with 10 Hz.
!  
!  A Ds_Fast job has to be loaded and started in each
!  node, where data for fast graphs should be stored.
