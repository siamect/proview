!  @Summary Limits an analog signal up/downwards
!  Limits an analog signal up/downwards and signals if a
!  limitation has taken place.
!  @image orm_limit_fo.gif
!
!  The limits Max and Min may be external signals or
!  adjustable parameters.
!  @image orm_en1-108.gif
!  The input signal may be fixed while one or both limits
!  are variable.
!  If one of the limits is not wanted the input signal may
!  also be connected to that limit.
