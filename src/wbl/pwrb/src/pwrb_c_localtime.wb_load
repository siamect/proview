!  @Code rt_plc_macro_time.h
!  @Group Plc,PlcTime
!  @Summary Convert an absolute time to second, minute, hour, month, day of month etc.
!  Convert an absolute time to seconds, minutes, hours, month, year, day of month, 
!  day of week and day of year.

!
!  The available outputs are:
!
!  Second   The  number of seconds after the minute, normally in the range 0

!  Minute   The number of minutes after the hour, in the range 0 to 59.
!  Hour     The number of hours past midnight, in the range 0 to 23.
!  MDay     The day of the month, in the range 1 to 31.
!  Month    The number of months since January, in the range 0 to 11.
!  Year     The number of years since 1900.
!  WDay     The number of days since Sunday, in the range 0 to 6
!  YDay     The number of days since January 1, in the range 0 to 365.
