!  @Group Plc,PlcAnalog
!  @Summary Time integrator
!  Time integrator.
!  @image orm_timint_fo.gif
!
!  A curve f(t) is supposed to be made up of a large
!  number of rectangular sections, each with a width
!  ScanTime and a height Int. The output varies in
!  accordance with both magnitude and duration of the
!  input. The output is proportional to the time integral
!  of the input.
!
!  ActVal(t) = ActVal(t-1) + In(t) * ScanTime / TimFact
!
!  where 1 / TimFact is the integrating rate.
!  
!  With the z-input it is possible to clear the
!  integrator.
!  @image orm_en1-235.gif
!
! @b Example 
!
!  Suppose In is in litres / min. If we want ActVal to be
!  in litres TimFact will be equal to 60 seconds /min.
