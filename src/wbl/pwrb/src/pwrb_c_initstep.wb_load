!  @Summary The first step in a Grafcet-chain
!  The first step in a Grafcet-chain.
!  @image orm_initstep_fo.gif
!
!  At least one InitStep object has to be included in
!  every sequential chain.
!  
!  The object is active when the PLC program that contains
!  the object is to start running.
!  The PlcPgm object has an attribute, ResetObject, where
!  the name of a Di , Do, or Dv object is specified. This
!  attribute is used as a reset signal in one or more
!  sequential chains in the PLC program in the following
!  way. When the reset signal makes the transition:
!  
!   - 0 -> 1 each Step, InitStep and Order object in the
!     PLC program becomes inactive. Stored orders are
!     aborted.
!   - 1 -> 0 the InitStep object(s) of the PLC program
!     becomes active.
!  
!  If individual reset signals are required for every
!  single sequential chain the number of sequential chains
!  has to be limited to one per PLC program.
!  The vertical connections are connected to Trans
!  objects.
!  
!  The horizontal connection may at the same time be
!  connected to one or more Order objects as well as one
!  or more Stoxx , Setxx or Resxx objects; see figure 3-51
!  on page 3-328. It may also be left open or used as an
!  ordinary binary signal; see figure 3-22 on page 3-184.
!
! @b Examples
!
!  Figure below shows how an InitStep , ISO, may be configured 
!  in a straight sequential chain. A chain is said to be straight 
!  if it does not contain any branching.
!  @image orm_en1-104.gif
!  InitStep Object in a Straight Sequential Chain 
!
!  The And object in figure below will be executed every time when 
!  the PLC program executes. The compilation may result in a warning 
!  'No Grafcet standard' because of the connections between the And 
!  object and the Order respectively InitStep object, but the solution 
!  works
