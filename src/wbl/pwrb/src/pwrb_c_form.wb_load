!  @Group Operator,NodeConfiguration
!  Configures a window to display a form.
!  
!  To display forms on a node the forms have to be
!  associated with a Form object located on the same node
!  as where the forms will be displayed.
!  The users or categories of users of an operator station
!  are represented by User objects. When a user of an
!  operator station wants to display a form the name of
!  the form shall be in a Form object and the name of such
!  a Form object in the FastAvail-attribute in the User
!  object of the user. In this way a Form object may be
!  used by several User objects.
!  
!  Puts the object below the $Node object at the same
!  level as the OpPlace object.
