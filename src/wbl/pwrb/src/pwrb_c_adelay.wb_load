!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_arithm.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcAnalog
!  @Summary Time delay of an analog signal
!  Time delay of an analog signal.
!  @image orm_adelay_fo.gif
!  
!  The time delay Tim can vary within the interval:
!
!       { 0 - 100 * MaxCount * ScanTime }
!
!  The delay is implemented in a 100-step shift register.
!  The time resolution per step is MaxCount * ScanTime and
!  maximum time delay is 100 * MaxCount * ScanTime.
!  
!  Several Adelay objects can be connected in series when
!  a higher resolution is needed.
!  If the time resolution per step is worse than the
!  program cycle time (i.e. MaxCount > 1) a mean value is
!  formed and stored in shift register 1.
!  
!  The very first sample is stored in every shift
!  register. At sample number 2 a mean value is calculated
!  from the value in shift register ( position) 1 and the
!  input signal, thereafter the mean value is restored in
!  shift register 1. This is repeated up to sample
!  MaxCount - 1. At sample number MaxCount a shift of the
!  register contents takes place and the input signal is
!  stored direct into the shift register 1. During the
!  time up to the next shift the mean value of the input
!  signal is stored in shift register position 1.
!  The output signal is fetched from the register
!  representing the actual delay.
!  
! @b Example
!
!  1. With MaxCount = 1 and ScanTime = 20 ms the maximum delay time
!     is 100 * 1 * 1 / 50 seconds.
!     if the delay Tim = 1, ActVal(t) will be = In(t-50), i.e. the input
!     signal is delayed by 50 execution cycles.
!
!  2. If MaxCount = 1 and ScanTime = 1 second represent each register the
!     delay of one second. Tim specifies from which register to get ActVal.
