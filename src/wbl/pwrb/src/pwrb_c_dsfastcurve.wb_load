!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  Stores data for a fast graph à la storage oscilloscope.
!  
!  In one DsFastCurve object, up to 10 attributes can be specified.
!  The storage of the attributes will be trigger by the same event,
!  stored with the same frequency, and the curves will be plotted 
!  in the same fastcurve window.
!
!  The names of the attributes is specified the the Attribute array.
!  For every attribute, a storage area object also has to be specified.
!  An attribute may be referred to by several different DsTrendCurve
!  objects, for example to store at different frequencies.
!  
!  The sampling rate is specified the the ScanTime attribute.
!  The sampling will start when a trigger event is detected. In some
!  cases, when data before the trigger event is valid, the sampling will
!  go on even before the trigger event.
!
!  The different types of triggering is specified in the Function attribute.
!
!  @b Trigg conditions
!  There are three ways to trigger a fast curve:
!
!  - Manual trigg. A manual trigg is executed by setting the TriggMan attribute.
!    Manual triggering has to be configured in the Function attribute.
!
!  - Trigg on a digital signal. If a reference to a digital attribute is put in 
!    TriggObject, a positive edge of this attribute will trigger the fastcurve.
!
!  - Level. The level of the first curve attribute can trigger the fastcurve. When the
!    value of the attribute passes the value in TriggLevel from beneath, a trigger will
!    take place. LevelTrigg has to be configured in the Function attribute.
!
!  @b Store data before trigg
!  Sometimes the data before the trigg is of interest, and this can be stored by setting 
!
!  - the BeforeTrigg bit in Functions
!  - the number of points before trigg that should be stored in NoOfPointsBeforeTrigg.
!
!  In the BeforeTrigg function the data has to continously stored before the trigger event. 
!  This continously storing is started by the user by setting the Prepare attribute, 
!  or as soon as the previous curve is displayed, if the AlwaysPrepared bit is configured 
!  in Function. In the latter case, the data of the previous curve is immediately 
!  overwritten after beeing displayed.
!
!  @b Storage arrays
!  Storage arrays has to be supplied by the user, one array for the time axis data, and
!  one for each configured attribute. For example, Buff1440, Buff4096 or Buff32k objects
!  can be used for the data storage. These will store up to 360, 1024 resp. 8192 points of
!  pwr_tFloat32 attributes.
!
!  @b Data types
!  The datatypes that can be stored is
!  - pwr_tFloat32, pwr_tFloat64
!  - pwr_tInt32, pwr_tUInt32, pwr_tInt16, pwr_tUInt16, pwr_tInt8, pwr_tUInt8
!  - pwr_tBoolean
!
!  The time is stored as pwr_tFloat32.
!
!  @b Server
!  DsFastCurve objects is handled by the fast server rt_fast.
!  The base frequency for the fast server process is configured in
!  the DsFastConf object.
!
