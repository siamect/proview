!  Buffer output signal base class.
!  
!  This class is used as a base class for Buffer input signals.
!  The buffer signal subclass should contain an ActualValue attribute and
!  an InitialValue attribute. 
!
!  ActualValue can be an array Int32 or Float32, or a String, and should be
!  specified as a pointer in the flags word.
!  InitalValue shoud be of the same size and type as ActualValue, and should
!  be placed after ActualValue.
!
!  In the size attribute, the total size in bytes of ActualValue should be
!  specified. If for example ActualValue is an Int32 array of 20 elements,
!  size is 80.
