!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group Operator,NodeConfiguration
!  @Summary Defines the action of a pushbutton in the operator window
!  The XttGraph object defines a xtt action for an operator, that can be
!  executed from a pushbutton in the operator window. An action can be
!  opening a ge graph or a java frame, or executing a xtt-command.
!
!  In the attribute Action, a xtt graph, java class or xtt-command can
!  be entered.
! 
!  The XttGraph object is connected to a pushbutton in the
!  operator window by entering the name of the XttGraph-object in the
!  FastAvail-array i the User-object for the operator place.
!
!  I the action is opening a ge graph, the graph can be opened from the
!  popup menu for an object by putting the name of the XttGraph in 
!  the DefGraph attribute for the object (or for an ancestor to the object).
!  This action i supported for all objects that contains a DefGraph attribute,
!  for example $PlantHier, Ai, Ao, Di, Do, Av and Dv.
