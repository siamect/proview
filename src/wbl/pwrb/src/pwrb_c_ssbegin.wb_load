!  The first Grafcet step in a sub-sequential chain.
!  @image orm_ssbegin_fo.gif
!
!  The object is set active when its parent, i.e. the
!  current SubStep object, becomes active. Compare with
!  the SsEnd object which is the last step in a
!  sub-sequential chain; see figure 3-50.
!  To the right output one or more Order objects can be
!  connected at the same time as well as one or more Stoxx,
!  Setxx or Resxx objects. The output can also be left
!  open or be used as an ordinary binary signal.
