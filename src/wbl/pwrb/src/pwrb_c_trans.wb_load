!  @Group Plc,PlcGrafcet
!  @Summary A Grafcet transition condition
!  A Grafcet transition condition.
!  @image orm_en1-236.gif
!
!  If the transition condition (see below) is satisfied,
!  and every step object (i.e. an object by the type Step,
!  InitStep, or SubStep) directly connected to the input
!  of the Trans object is active, the active status will
!  be transferred to all the step objects directly
!  connected to the output of the Trans object, while the
!  earlier active step objects become inactive.
!  
!  The possible transition conditions are as follows:
!  
!  1  an underlying conditional window. The objects in the
!     window get a WindowCond object (see p. 3-394) as
!     parent object. The status of the conditional window
!     is stored in the Trans object by means of a SetCond
!     object in the window.
!
!  2  directly in a combinational circuit connected to the
!     left horizontal part of the symbol (see T4 in figure
!     3-55 on p. 3-366).
!
!  3  the condition is set as always TRUE ( Cond = 1 ) or
!     always FALSE ( Cond = 0 ) at the configuring.
!
!  To the vertical line of the symbol step objects are
!  connected. When status is transferred it is always from
!  the step/s/ that precede the Trans object to the
!  step/s/ that follow the Trans object.
!  
!  The operator gets the opportunity to control the
!  transition condition manually by setting Man = 1. The
!  conditional window is being executed as usual, but the
!  operator can override the transition condition by
!  setting OpCond. As soon as a manually initiated
!  transition has taken place the OpCond flag is cleared
!  by the ProviewR system which implies that the operator
!  has to set the OpCond flag to trigger each transition.
!  The Man flag remains set until cleared by the operator.
!  At reset of a sequential chain ( see the description of
!  InitStep, are neither the Man flag nor the
!  OpCond flag is cleared.
!

!  Transition Condition with Different Types of Conditions.
!  Parallel Sequences 
!
!  In figure Transition Condition with Different Types of
!  Conditions. Parallel Sequences the thick vertical lines
!  indicate that the transition conditions T5, T6, and T7
!  have underlying conditional windows. The transition
!  condition T4 has its transition condition directly
!  accessible.
