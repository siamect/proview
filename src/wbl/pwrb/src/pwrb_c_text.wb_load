!  @Summary Single-row text object
!  Single-row text object.
!
!  If no text is specified, in e.g. a Frame object, the
!  object can be used to frame other objects.
!  
!  The only difference between Head, Text, Title and Frame
!  is the default values of the attributes.
!  @image orm_text_3.gif
!  They are used in Document objects where, for instance,
!
!   - Title specifies what the configuration is doing, i.e.
!     the function.
!   - Sub-functions are named by Head objects.
!   - Frame and Text are used to information of details.
!
! @b Hints
!  A well-done PLC program ought to contain not only objects necessary 
!  to the computer execution but also objects whose purpose are to make 
!  the program more easy to understand to later readers. See figure below. 
!  @image orm_en1-82.gif
!  Title, Head and Text Objects Make the Program Easy to Read.
