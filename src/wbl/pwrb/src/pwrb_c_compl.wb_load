!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_arithm.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcAnalog
!  @Summary Compares an analog value with a low limit
!  Compares an analog value (signal or parameter) with a
!  low limit.
!  @image orm_en1-38.gif 
!  Both the input signal and the limit can be either
!  constants, defined by the Attribute Editor, or ordinary
!  analog signals.
!  @image orm_en1-39.gif
!  The output is TRUE when the input signal is less than
!  the low limit, i.e. Lim.
!  
!  The hysteresis is taken into account when the output
!  signal is to be FALSE. The output becomes FALSE as soon
!  as the input becomes greater than or equal to the low
!  limit plus the hysteresis.
