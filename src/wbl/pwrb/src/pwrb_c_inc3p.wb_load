!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_pid.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcControl
!  @Summary Incremental 3-point output with dead zone
!  Incremental 3-point output with dead zone. Incremental
!  comes from the type of input and the digit 3 of the
!  output, which can have three distinct values, e.g. open
!  / close / 0 but also with the meaning of up / down / 0
!  or right / left / 0 or increase / decrease / 0 etc. The
!  outputs are time-proportional to the input.
!  @image orm_en1-100.gif
!  
!  The input signal OutChange is regarded as a control
!  error. This error is transformed into a time by
!  multiplication with Gain. The product is added to
!  accumulator Acc. The absolute value of Acc is limited
!  to MaxWindup.
!  
!  If the absolute value of Acc > MinTim either the output
!  Open or Close is set. If Acc > MinTim an incremental
!  signal is set (= Open) as long as Acc ³ 0 , if, on the
!  other hand, Acc < - MinTim a decrease signal (= Close)
!  is set as long as Acc £ 0. The value of Acc is counted
!  down respectively up with a time amount of ScanTime, at
!  every scanning when an increment or decrement signal
!  has been set.
!
!  To avoid ripple on the outputs, which may be
!  destructive to the actuator at small control errors,
!  the absolute value of the Acc-attribute has to exceed
!  the adjustable dead zone MinTim, before any control
!  signal is set. The Acc-attribute is cleared if the
!  value of Acc does not exceed the dead zone during a
!  time specified by MaxTim; the integration is turned off
!  at small control errors.
!  @image orm_en1-101.gif
!  Output Signals from an Inc3P 
!  
!  So-called timer control, also used by Pos3P objects on
!  page 3-287, is discussed in the example below.
!  Exactly as for Pos3P it is possible to govern by means
!  of the outputs Open / Close and/or the signals named by
!  DoOpen/DoClose. The outputs and the signals can be set
!  by a frequency determined by the PlcPgm object. But
!  only the signals may be reset by the timer control.
!
! @h1 Example
!
! @b Timer Control of Outputs 
!
!  Suppose a flow control with an electrically-activated valve 
!  with increment/decrement control. The flow signal ( here kalle2) 
!  exists. One solution is shown in figure below. Note, the 
!  incremental output of the Pid object is used. 
!  @image orm_en1-102.gif
!  Three step Control without Position Feedback 
!
!  The last segment names of the signals named by DoOpen and DoClose 
!  are shown in the symbol of INC3P0; here Do2 and Do1.
