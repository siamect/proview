!  @Group Plc,PlcGrafcet
!  @Summary Stores the status of a conditional window into the parent object
!  Stores, in the associated object, i.e. an Order or
!  Trans object, the status of a conditional window.
!  @image orm_setcond_fo.gif
!
!  A conditional window is used by Trans objects and Order
!  objects with C-order attribute. For instance, the
!  result of a combinational circuit is stored by a
!  SetCond object. See figure below.
