!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_drive.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcDrive
!  @Summary Motor valve positioner
!  Motor valve positioner with three operating states and
!  supervision of operation time and contactor response.
!  @image orm_en1-123.gif
!
!  This object is similar to the Valve object but can
!  furthermore be stopped in a continues order, i.e.
!  three-level action.
!  The operating states, here named OPEN, STOP, and CLOSE,
!  can be interpreted as: up - stop - down, right - stop -
!  left, increase - stop - decrease etc.
!  
!  By means of the operation time supervision it is
!  possible to detect if the final control element is
!  stopped between the two operating states.
!
!  One of three operating modes, LOCAL / MANUAL / AUTO, is
!  selected by means of the input signal Local and the
!  output signal ManMode in the following way:
!  @image orm_en1-124.gif
!
!  In AUTO mode AutoOpen/AutoClose-request remains as long
!  as the operation has to continue, else the motion stops
!  in some intermediate position.
!  If there are conflicting requests the request with the
!  highest priority wins; see below.
!  @image orm_en1-125.gif
!
!  Contactor alarm, Alarm5 or Alarm 6, stops current
!  operation. A new order resets the alarms and initiates
!  a new operation.
!
! @h1 Example
!
! @b Carriage Operation 
!  @image orm_en1-126.gif
!
!  The carriage is run only in MANUAL mode. 
!
!  Contactor response and motion guard have the same supervision time. 
!  The supervision of the operation response also have to make an alarm.

!  MValve Object Used in Motor Control
!
! @b Control Valve
!  @image orm_en1-127.gif
!  Motor Valve Control
!
!  At LowLow-level the valve runs to closed position and at emergency 
!  stop ( 'nödstopp' in Swedish) all control of the valve stops.
!  
!  Alarm at error in contactor response or too long operation time. 
!  Operational order is broken by activated end limit position.
