!  @Summary Build configuration root object.
!  The BuildConfig is the root object for the build configuration.
!  This object is placed in the directory volume as toplevel object
!  in the node view.
!
!  The build configuration makes it possible to handle
!  - building of applications, with execution of makefiles and copying 
!    of include files.
!  - copying of graph files.
!  - copying of configuration files from $pwrp_cnf.
!  - importing files from other projects.
!  - exporting files to other projects.
!
!  Other objects in the build configuration
!  
!  @bBuildDirectory
!  Configures how a directory, eg $pwrp_appl or $pwrp_pop is built. The 
!  actions executed when building the directory is specified with
!  BuildCopy, BuildMake and BuildExecute object.
!
!  @bBuildCopy
!  Copies a file, or a number of files specified with wildcard from the
!  source directory to the build tree.
!
!  @bBuildMake
!  Executes a make file.
!
!  @bBuildExec
!  Executes a shell command.
!  
!  @bExport
!  Configures files that should be exported to other projects. Normally
!  files are exported to a common directory from where they are imported
!  by other projects. Specific files to export is configured with 
!  ApplExport objects.
!
!  @bImport
!  Configures files that is imported from other projects. Specific
!  files are imported with ApplImport objects.
!

!  a node, by configuring BuildBeforeNode or BuildAfterNode in the Option
!  attribute of the BuildDirectory, Import and Export objects.
!
!  To perform an selective build, export or import, the Build Directories,
!  Import and Export window is opened from the Functions menu in the 
!  configurator.
