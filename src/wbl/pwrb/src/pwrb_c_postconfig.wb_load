!  Configuration of event post server.
!
!  The Post server receives alarm events from the event monitor
!  and forwards them to SMS numbers and email addresses.
!
!  Alarms forwarded should have SMS or Email in the Flags attribute
!  of the DSup, ASup or CycleSup object. A Recipient is also specified
!  in the sup object, and this recipient is search for in the user database
!  under the current system group, and from the found user, the SMS number
!  or email address is fetched. Also a list of recipients can be specifed,
!  separated by comma, and the event is forwarded to the SMS number or
!  email address of all these users.
!
!  A recipient can, in the sup object, be specified by a symbol. The should
!  be defined in the Symbol table in the PostConfig object. If for example
!  the recipient is specified with '$on_duty', and a symbol with name 'on_duty'
!  and value 'john, dennis' is defined in symbol table, the event will be
!  forwarded to the users john and dennis.
!
!  The command to send a SMS or email depeneds on the utility that is used,
!  and you have to insert the shell command for the utility in the
!  EmailCmd and SMS_Cmd attributes. Replace the email address or SMS number
!  with the string '$address' and the message text with the string '$text'.
