!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_pid.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcControl
!  @Summary Converts an analog signal into a pulsed binary signal
!  Converts an analog signal into a binary signal which
!  varies in the time. The binary output has a
!  pulse-proportional relay action in the dead zone, if
!  MinOut < MaxOut, else on/off-action with hysteresis.
!  @image orm_out2p_fo.gif
! 
!  The digit 2 in the object name comes from the output
!  which may have two distinct values with a two-step
!  action; e.g. full on / full off but also with the
!  meaning of open / closed, forward / backward, or right
!  / left etc.
!  
!  Two cases exist:
!  1. MinOut < MaxOut
!
!    If OutVal < MinOut the Order is always FALSE and if OutVal > MaxOut the Order is always TRUE. 
!
!    @image orm_en1-136.gif
!    When MinOut = OutVal = MaxOut the output, Order, has a pulse-proportional relay action
!    with the cycle time Period . 
!
!    At pulse-proportional relay control the proportion between On/off is the same as the
!    proportion of (OutVal - MinOut) / (MaxOut - MinOut)
!
!    This quotient is updated at every scanning. If a period starts with an on-state it will
!    remain until,
!    (OutVal(t) - MinOut) / (MaxOut(t) - MinOut(t) * Period = time from last change of state 
!
!    After this it will be off-state until,
!    1 - (OutVal(t) - MinOut) / (MaxOut(t) - MinOut(t) * Period = time from last change of state 
!
!  2. MinOut = MaxOut gives the output an on/off-action with hysteresis, likewise a combined
!     Compl and Comph object
