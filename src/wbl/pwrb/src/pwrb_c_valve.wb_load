!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_drive.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcDrive
!  @Summary Valve positioner with on/off state
!  Valve positioner with two states, i.e. on-off action
!  and operation time supervision.
!  @image orm_en1-238.gif
!
!  The two operating states, here named OPEN and CLOSE,
!  can be interpreted as full on or full off, open or
!  closed etc. The operation order OrderOpen is either
!  TRUE or FALSE.
!  
!  By means of the operation time supervision it is
!  possible to detect if the final control element is
!  stopped between the two operating states.
!  One of three operating modes, LOCAL / MANUAL / AUTO, is
!  selected by means of the input signal Local and the
!  output signal ManMode in the following way:  
!  @image orm_en1-239.gif
!
! @b LOCAL
!  Used at operation from for example an outer
!  operator's console, switching equipment, etc.
!  
!  - Only the safety interlockings, SafeOpen and
!    SafeClose, are taken into account.
!
!  - LocalOpen has a spring back push button
!    function. It sets OrderOpen to TRUE when
!    activated.
!  
!  - LocalClose has a spring back push button
!    function. It resets OrderOpen when
!    activated.
!
!  - At the changes,  
!    -- LOCAL --> AUTO AutoOpen is concerned.
!    -- LOCAL --> MANUAL OrderOpen remains unaffected.
!
! @b MANUAL/AUTO
!  - Both production and safety interlockings are
!    concerned.
!  
!  - The alarms are indicators that do not
!    influence the operation order unless they
!    are connected to some interlocking signal.
!
!  - In MANUAL mode OPEN/CLOSE request is handled
!    by the operator by means of the attributes
!    ManOpen respectively ManClose.
!  
!    In AUTO mode OPEN request is done when
!    AutoOpen is TRUE; CLOSE when AutoOpen is
!    FALSE, i.e. not at any edge but on the
!    levels.
!  
!  - The changes,
!    -- AUTO -> MANUAL, do not influence the
!       operation order OrderOpen.
!  
!    -- MANUAL -> AUTO. If the operation order was
!       set in MANUAL operating mode and AutoOpen is TRUE,
!       the operation order remains set after the transition,
!       otherwise not.
!  
!  If there are conflicting requests the request with the
!  highest priority wins; see below.
!  @image orm_en1-241.gif
!
! @h1 Example 
!
! @b Pump with a valve 
!  @image orm_en1-242.gif
!  At request to start the pump shall the valve first open
!  and then the pump start. 
!
!  @image orm_en1-243.gif
!  At flushing the valve has to be opened, and this is done
!  by means of the Dv- signal 'Spola'.
