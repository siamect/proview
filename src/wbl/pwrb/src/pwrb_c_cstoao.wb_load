!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_macro_io.h
!  @Group Plc,PlcIO
!  @Summary Conditional storage of Ao signal
!  Conditional Storage Analog output.
!  @image orm_cstoao_fo.gif
!  
!  Conditional storage of an analog value on a specified
!  local Ao-signal (= Ao object).
!  
!  Conditional is aimed at the con-input, which is
!  supposed to be connected.
!  @image orm_en1-43.gif
!  The conditional input signal can be inverted by means
!  of the Attribute Editor.
!  
!  It is not allowed, by means of a function in C or PLC
!  programs, to write in any of the inputs.
