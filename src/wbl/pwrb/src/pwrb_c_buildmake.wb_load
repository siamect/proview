!  @Summary Configures build actions with make.
!  The BuildMake object configures build actions performed with GNU make.
!  
!  The object reside in the project volume beneath an BuildDirectory object.
!
!  The execution is carried out when Build Directories in the configurator menu 
!  is activated.
!
!  If the Options attribute in the BuildDirectory object is set to BuildBeforeNode
!  the makefile is executed automatically before a node is built. In this case
!  the makefile is first executed with the -q option to examine if any dependencies
!  needs to be updated. The result is a dependency for if the node is rebuilt or not.
!
!  If Build Force is set in the settings, the makefile is executed with the -B
!  option (unconditionally make all targets).
