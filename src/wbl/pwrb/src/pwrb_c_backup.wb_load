!/**
!  @Version 2.0
!  @Code rt_plc_macro_logic.h
!  @Group Plc,PlantConfiguration
!  @Summary Backup of objects or attributes
!  Points out a data segment in rtdb where the items will
!  be backed up on a file.
!  @image orm_backup_fo.gif
!  
!  If the segment pointed out by the Backup object was
!  created in the development environment the backup may
!  concern either the whole object or single attributes in
!  the object pointed out. In the development environment
!  the Backup object can be configured either by the
!  Configuration Editor or the PLC Editor.
!  
!  Backup objects created by the Configuration Editor is
!  located below $PlantHier objects. The Backup object and
!  the object referred to have to reside on the same
!  target node, else no backup will be done. DataName
!  specifies what to backup.
!
!  The input of a backup object configured by the PLC
!  Editor, is connected to the output of the object that
!  will be backed up. It is assumed that this output is
!  supplied with the output-flag. ObjectBackup specifies
!  if the whole object or only the connected output
!  attribute is to be backed up. DataName is filled in at
!  the initialisation of the PLC job.
!  
!  Backup of objects configured and created in run time
!  always concerns only the whole object, not a single
!  attribute. The corresponding backup object is also
!  configured and created in run time.
!  
! @b Hints 
!  Note! Whole signal objects should not be backed up, as 
!  this might cause problems after booting.
!  
!  Every type of signal object has a pointer *ActualValue
!  and it is not likely that this will be the  same after
!  booting as before. If backup of a single attribute in a
!  signal object is required, e.g. ActualValue in an Av
!  object, backup that attribute and not the whole object.
!  When the run-time environment of a node is created the
!  attributes of the instances get default values.
!  Instances in the backup file which,
!  
!  - are to be found in node's rtdb will be updated
!    according to the back-up
!  - are missed in rtdb, because they are deleted, or
!    have got a new name e.g., will be skipped
!  
!  One cannot presuppose at change of ProviewR distribution
!  that the back-up file will works.
