!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group ProjectConfiguration
!  @Summary Configures a Qcom bus.
!  The Bus object configures a Qcom bus that nodes in the project will
!  communicate on.
!
!  Qcom is the communication protocoll for ProviewR nodes and proview
!  processes. Nodes that will communicate over Qcom has to use the same
!  Qcom bus. Communication between nodes in different busses is not possible.
!  
!  A Qcom bus is specified with a busnumber in the interval 0-999.
!
!  The BusConfig object should be configured in the directory volume as a top 
!  object. Below this, each node of the system, that belong to this Qcom bus, 
!  should be configured with a NodeConfig object.
!
!  It is common to configure at least two different Qcom busses in a system, one
!  for the production nodes and one for simulation nodes.
