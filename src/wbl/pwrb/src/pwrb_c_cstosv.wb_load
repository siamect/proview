!  Conditional storage of string value.
!  @image orm_cstosv_fo.gif
!
!  Conditional storage of a string value on a specified
!  local Sv object.
!  Conditional is aimed at the con-input, which is
!  supposed to be connected.
!  
!  The conditional input signal can be inverted by means
!  of the Attribute Editor.
!
!  The string input can be connected to an output of type String.
!  It can also be hidden and instead, a constant string can be inserted,
!  as a value of the input. The constant string is displayed in the plc-sheet.
!  
!  It is not allowed, by means of a function in C or PLC
!  programs, to write in any of the inputs.
