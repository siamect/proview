!  @Summary Limits a quantity's rate of change
!  Limits a quantity's rate of change.
!  @image orm_ramp_fo.gif
!
!  Separate limit rates at increase respectively decrease;
!  RampUp and RampDown.
!  Sets du = RampUp * ScanTime and dn = RampDown * ScanTime.
!  An input signal determines the output signal in the following way
!  @image orm_en1-185.gif
! 
!  An external signal may also be used as feedback. See example below.
!
! @b Example 
!  In this example an external signal is connected to the FB-input of
!  the Ramp object. The feedback connection from the Select object to
!  the Ramp object is of the type analog feedback.
!  As long as Control is FALSE the output of the Select object is
!  ramped up and down. When Control is TRUE the output gets the constant
!  value of RampUp ScanTime .
