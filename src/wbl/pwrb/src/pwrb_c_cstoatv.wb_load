!  @Code rt_plc_macro_time.h
!  @Group Plc,PlcTime
!  @Summary Conditional storage of absolute time value.
!  Conditional storage of absolute time value.
!  @image orm_cstoatv_fo.gif
!
!  Conditional storage of an absolute time value on a specified
!  local ATv object.
!  Conditional is aimed at the con-input, which is
!  supposed to be connected.
!  
!  The conditional input signal can be inverted by means
!  of the Attribute Editor.
!
!  The time input can be connected to an output of type Time.
!  It can also be hidden and instead, a constant time can be inserted,
!  as a value of the input. The constant time is displayed in the plc-sheet.
!  
!  It is not allowed, by means of a function in C or PLC
!  programs, to write in any of the inputs.
