!  Configures the SevHist monitor process.
!  
!  The SevHist monitor process keeps track of all SevHist objects
!  in the current node. The process is divided into threads that 
!  collect data with a specific scantime and sends to the specified
!  database server. The threads are specified by SevHistThread objects
!  that reside under the SevHistMonitor object in the node hierarchy.
