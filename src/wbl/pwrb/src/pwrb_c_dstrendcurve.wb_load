SObject pwrb:Class
!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  Stores data for a trend graph.
!  
!  In one DsTrendCurve object, up to 10 attributes can be specified.
!  The attribute values will be stored with the same frequency, and the 
!  curves will be plotted in the same trend window.
!
!  The names of the attributes is specified the the Attribute array.
!  For every attribute, a storage area object also has to be specified.
!  An attribute may be referred to by several different DsTrendCurve
!  objects, for example to store at different frequencies.
!  
!  The sampling rate is specified the the ScanTime attribute.
!
!  @b Storage buffers
!  Storage buffers has to be supplied by the user, one buffer for the time axis data, and
!  one for each configured attribute. Object of type CircBuffer has to be used, eg 
!  CircBuff1k, CircBuff2k, CircBuff10k, CircBuff20k, CircBuf100k and CircBuff200k.
!  A CircBuff1k object will for example store 250 samples of size 4 bytes and a 
!  CircBuff200k 50000.
!
!  @b Data types
!  The datatypes that can be stored is
!  - pwr_tFloat32, pwr_tFloat64
!  - pwr_tInt32, pwr_tUInt32, pwr_tInt16, pwr_tUInt16, pwr_tInt8, pwr_tUInt8
!
!  The time is stored as one or two UInt32, dependent on the selected TimeResolution.
!  The default time is of size 4 bytes where the seconds from epoch is stored. With time
!  resolution nanoseconds the size is 8 bytes, and one word with the nanoseconds are added
!  for each sample.
!
!  @b Server
!  DsTrendCurve objects is handled by the fast server rt_trend.
!  The base frequency for the fast server process is configured in
!  the DsTrendConf object.
!
!  @b User storage
!  Trend data can be stored by a user defined server, for example by the plc program.
!  In this case a number of setting has to be done:
!  - Function is set to 1.
!  - AttributeType should be set, eg pwrs:Type-$Float32.
!  - Attribute should be set to an arbitrary attribute. The only function for the attribute
!    is the curve name.
!  - ScanTime should be set to the time difference between two samples.
!  In the Buffer object, the Size (max number of samples) and ElementSize in bytes should be set.
!  To fill in the samples the functions cbuf_AddSample() and cbuf_AddTimeSample() can be used.
!  In this example the trend is filled in from a DataArithm where the data buffer is connected
!  to Da1 and the time buffer to Da2.
!
!    classdef Da1 CircBuff10k;
!    classdef Da2 CircBuff20k;
!    pwr_tTime time;
!
!    time_GetTime(&time);
!    cbuf_AddSample(Da1, &A1);
!    cbuf_AddTimeSample(Da2, &time);
