!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group PlantConfiguration,Signals
!  @Summary Digital input signal
!  Digital input.
!  
!  Configures a digital input signal in the Plant
!  Configuration.
!  
!  The internal filter function, where FilterType
!  specifies selected filter, concerns local Di signals,
!  i.e. remote Di-signals are not affected by the internal
!  filter function.
!  The filter function means e.g. that the designer
!  without any extra configuration and direct in the
!  object may specify if:
!  
!  - the sampled signal have to be set for a certain time
!  to be valid
!  - a minimum of time have to elapse from that the
!  sampled signal latest become FALSE until it is
!  allowed to be TRUE again.
!  
!         Hints
!  
!  Put the object below a $PlantHier object in the
!  development environment in such a way that it belongs
!  to the same target node as its associated channel
!  object.
