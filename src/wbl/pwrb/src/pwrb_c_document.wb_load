!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group Plc,PlcEdit
!  @Summary Configures documents in the PLC editor
!  Configures in the working area of the PLC Editor an
!  area in A-format.
!  @image orm_en1-56.gif
!  
!  By at the time of configuration of a PLC program,
!  divide the working surface in Document objects and
!  arrange the PLC objects in such a way that the PLC
!  object are included in Document objects, it will be
!  possible to write the whole configuration on a number
!  of A4-papers.
!  
!  The working surface in the PLC Editor may contains an
!  arbitrary number of Document objects.
!  Document object is selected by the pointing device
!  through a click on the border or in the head of the
!  object.
!  
!  By the Attribute Editor the object's orientation,
!  format, page number and the signature are specified.
!  The fields in the head of the object are filled in by
!  the development environment at the time of
!  transcription.
!  At transcription one PostScript file per Document
!  object will be created. The file is default located on
!  'pwrp_tmp'.
!  
!  If there is a need for a larger working surface choose
!  A3 format in the Document object. The objects in the
!  transcription will be somewhat reduced in scale
!  compared with objects in a Document object with A4
!  format but nevertheless they are fully readable.
