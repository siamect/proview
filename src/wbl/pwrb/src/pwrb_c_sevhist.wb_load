!/**
!  @Version 2.0
!  @Group PlantConfiguration,SevHist
!  @Summary Configures historical data storage for a value.
!  Configures historical data storage for a scalar
!  quantity or element in a one-dimensional vector. (Datastorage
!  History).
!  
!  In a relational database, data resides in
!  two-dimensional tables known as relations. A relation
!  consist of rows and columns.
!  
!  The SevHist object specifies which quantity is to be
!  stored and in which relation. Up to three different
!  relations can be specified.

!  Hints
!  
!  If the storage concern signal values SevHist is
!  configured in the development environment often direct
!  below the current signal object.
