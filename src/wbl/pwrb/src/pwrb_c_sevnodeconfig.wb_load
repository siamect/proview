!  @Summary Configures a ProviewR storage environment node.
!  The SevNodeConfig object configures a ProviewR storage environment node.
!  
!  The SevNodeConfig object is used when a node only contains the storage
!  environment, not the runtime environment. If the node also contains the
!  runtime environment it should be configured with a NodeConfig object.
!
!  The SevNodeConfig object is created in the project volume as a child to
!  a BusConfig-object in the node-hierachy.
!
!  A root volumes has to be registred and configured for the node. The volume
!  should contain a SevServer object in the node hierarchy.
