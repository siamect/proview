!/**
!  @Version 2.1
!  @Group Operator,NodeConfiguration
!  @Summary Configures a group of trend or fast graphs
!  Configures a group of trend or fast graphs.
!  
!  The PlotGroup object brings together a number of fast or
!  trend graphs into a group of graphs by the
!  corresponding data storage objects
!  being pointed out by YObjectName. 
!  In Xtt up to 20 graphs from storage objects can be displayed,
!  and in the GMS operators environment, up to 4 can be displayed.
!  The graphs brought together, in reality the measured quantities,
!  may be sampled by different frequencies.
!  The graphs are always plotted as a function of time.
!  Suppose that the fastest sampled measured quantity in a
!  group is being sampled by the frequency BaseFrequency.
!  The width of the "time window" at the display is then
!  NumPoints * BaseFrequency.
!  Between samples in a slowly sampled graph interpolation
!  takes place.
!  
! @b Hints
!  The buttons 'Trend' and 'Fast' in the operator
!  environment display both lists of those PlotGroup objects
!  ( or graphs) that are available on the node independent
!  of the user. Which list a specific PlotGroup object
!  belongs to depends of Trend.
!
!  The users 'Host' and 'Process', according to figure below, will
!  get lists with the same appearance but by grouping the PlotGroup
!  objects in separate hierarchies is it possible to the designer to
!  indicate which 'graphs' concern 'Host' respectively 'Process'
