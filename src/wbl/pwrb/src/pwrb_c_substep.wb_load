!  @Summary Grafcet step representing a sub-sequential chain
!  Grafcet step representing an underlying sequential
!  chain, a sub-sequential chain.
!  @image orm_substep_fo.gif
!
!  From a functional point of view, we can look upon the
!  object as a sub-sequential chain that has been
!  substituted by the SubStep object.
!  
!  The sub-sequential chain is edited in an underlying
!  sub-window. The objects in the window get a
!  WindowSubStep object as parent object.
!  Such a sub-window,
!   - starts with a SsBegin object, which becomes active
!     when the SubStep object becomes active.
!   - ends with a SsEnd object, which tells when the
!     SubStep object is finished.
!
!  To the right output one or more Order objects can be
!  connected at the same time as well as one or more Stoxx,
!  Setxx or Resxx objects. The output can also be left
!  open or be used as an ordinary binary signal.
!  
!  An active status cannot be transferred from a SubStep
!  object until the SsEnd object in the sub-sequential
!  chain has signalled ready and the condition following
!  the SubStep object is satisfied. When so, active status
!  is transferred from the SubStep object to the next step
!  in the chain.
!  
!  Note! If the visual differences in the SubStep symbol are
!  small, when there is a subwindow and when there is not,
!  the consequences are important. A SubStep object
!  without an underlying sub-window implies that the
!  execution is caught in the SubStep object.
!  A condition of structured configuring is the
!  possibilities to configure in levels. A SubStep can in
!  its sub-sequential chain contain SubStep objects. Such
!  a SubStep object can then in its sub-sequential chain
!  contain further SubStep objects and so on.
