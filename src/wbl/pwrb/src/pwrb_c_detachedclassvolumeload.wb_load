!  @Summary Configures a class volume to load in a ProviewR node.
!  The DetachedClassVolumeLoad object configures a detached class volume to
!  load into a ProviewR node when ProviewR is started on this node.
!  If a mounted volume contains objects of classes that is not loaded
!  by default into the node, a DetachedClassVolumeLoad object will force a
!  load of the classvolume.
!
!  The object should be configured in the  project volume as a child 
!  to a NodeConfig object.
!
!  The name of the object states the volume to load.
