!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_macro_grafcet.h
!  @Group Plc,PlcGrafcet
!  @Summary Resets a stored Grafcet order
!  Resets a stored Grafcet order when the input is TRUE.
!  @image orm_reset_so_fo.gif
!
!  If the Order object has no S-order attribute nothing
!  will happens.
!  Usually, the Reset_SO is located in a Grafcet program,
!  but it is not necessary. It does no matter if it is
!  located in an ordinary PLC program.
!  
!  Contains no relevant information (=data) in rtdb.
!
! @b Hints 
!  One way to specify the complete name of the Order object in the Reset_SO object is to: 
!
!  - Selects, in the Navigator, the actual Order object. 
!  - Double click with Ctrl/ MB1 (= the left button of a 3-button mouse)
!    on the right part of the Reset_SO's symbol. 
!  - The last segment name of the Order object is then shown in the symbol 
!    of Reset_SO. In figure below the last segment name of the Order object is Ord1.
