!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group PlantConfiguration,Signals
!  @Summary Pulse output signal
!  Pulse Output. A modified Do object to make specified
!  pulses on a Do-channel.
!  
!  Po objects are associated to ChanDo in the same way as
!  Do objects. Note that it is ActualValue
!  before any eventual inversion that are used to initiate
!  pulses.
!  The object generates, when ActualValue makes a certain
!  transition, a pulse with the duration of PulseLength.
!  PosFlank specifies which ActualValue transition that
!  will initiate a pulse. If a positive or negative pulse
!  is generated depend on PosPulse.
!  @image orm_en1-171.gif
!
!  ActualValue is handled e.g. from application programs
!  by the system call: gdh_SetObjectInfo(...)
!  If ResetActualValue = TRUE, ProviewR will restore
!  ActualValue after trigger detection. The restoration is
!  done independent of the current state of the output;
!  i.e. independent of any eventual propagating pulse or
!  not. Repeated triggering during propagating pulse do
!  not affect the existing pulse.
!  
!  The output signal is equal to FixedOutValue when
!  EmergBreakTrue is TRUE and EmergBreakSelect = 2 and
!  equal to TestValue when TestOn is TRUE, i.e. no
!  filtering in this cases.
!  
! @b Hints
!  Put the object below a $PlantHier object in the
!  development environment in such a way that it belongs
!  to the same target node as its associated channel
