!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  Makes it possible to indicate, in cross- and external
!  reference lists, reading/writing in objects/attributes
!  made from application programs.
!  
!  By means of pwr_plc and ListDescriptor
!  it is possible to create lists that show the name of
!  objects referred to below a current object. But it is
!  not sure that such lists are always complete. A
!  signal(object) can, for example, also be influenced by
!  application programs and this will not be shown in any
!  list. To make it possible to include such manipulations
!  in cross- and external reference lists ExternRef
!  objects are used.
!  The object exists only in the development environment.
!  
!  Hints
!  
!  Assume a PROVIEW/R system with process graphics, from
!  which attributes in rtdb are manipulated. The designer
!  wants to make this manipulations visible in cross- and
!  reference lists. Figure below shows one solution.
!  @image orm_en1-74.gif
!  Configuration of ExternRef Objects 
!
!  The ExternRef objects of the process graphics are here 
!  collected below an object named OperatorCom. The ExternRef 
!  objects of certain process graphics have then been collected 
!  below its own $PlantHier object.
