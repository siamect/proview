!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Code rt_plc_arithm.c
!  @Group Plc,PlcAnalog
!  @Summary Compares an analog value to a high limit
!  Compares an analog value ( signal or parameter) to a high
!  limit.
!  @image orm_en1-36.gif
!  
!  Both the input signal and the limit can be either
!  constants, defined by the Attribute Editor, or ordinary
!  analog signals.
!  @image orm_en1-37.gif
!  The output is TRUE when the input signal is greater
!  than the high limit i.e. Lim. The hysteresis is taken
!  into account when the output signal is to be FALSE. The
!  output becomes FALSE as soon as the input becomes less
!  than or equal to the high limit minus the hysteresis.
