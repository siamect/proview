SObject pwrs:Class
!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group PlantConfiguration
!  Puts objects or object structures aside, which, by some
!  reason, should not be used in the current runtime
!  system.
!  
!  $LibHier object is created in the work-bench by means
!  of the Configuration Editor. It can be located only in
!  the Plant Configuration.
!  
!  A ProviewR system can have several $LibHier (Library
!  Hierarchy ) objects placed on the top level or below
!  another $LibHier object.
!  Objects located below a $LibHier object will not be
!  loaded into the runtime system. This will be the case
!  for example when new structures are under development
!  in an existing ProviewR system, when a PLC program is
!  not to be used at the moment but maybe later etc.
!  
!  Also structures from the Node Configuration can be
!  placed below a $LibHier object. But if the goal is to
!  prevent a new node structure under development from
!  being loaded into the runtime system, please do not
!  Create Load Files ... to the node.
!  Contains no relevant information (=data) in rtdb.
