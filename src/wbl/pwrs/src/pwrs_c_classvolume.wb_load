SObject pwrs:Class
!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group Volumes,ClassDefinition
!  A class volume contains class and type definition objects.
!  
!  Classes and types in proview, are specified with objects, such
!  as ClassDef, ObjBodyDef, Attribute, Type and TypeDef etc.
!  These classdefinition object reside in classvolumes.
!
!  To create an instance object of a specific class, the classvolume of
!  of this class has to be loaded.
!
!  ClassVolumes are divided into the groups system classvolumes, 
!  manufacturer classvolumes and user classvolumes. System and
!  manufacturer classvolumes comes with the ProviewR release, and
!  the loadfiles reside on $pwr_load.
!
!  User classvolumes contains local classes for a project. 
!  The volume has to be registred in the global volume list, and is
!  identified by a volume identity.
!  
!  In the directory volume of a project, a user class volume is 
!  configured by a ClassVolumeConfig object.
!
!  If a node contains instances of classes in a specific classvolume,
!  this volume is loaded at runtime startup, and doesn't have to be
!  configured with any volume load object.
!
!  If a node doesn't contain any instances, but has to display or
!  subscribe to remote objects of the class, you should specify
!  that the class volume should be loaded with a ClassVolumeLoad object
!  in the directory volume. If this is not done, classes can be loaded
!  at runtime from remote nodes, using the class cashe. The class cashe
!  is also used if the class is loaded, but the version of the class 
!  differs on the remote node.
!
!  The user class volume is edited in the class editor, which is opened
!  from the directory volume, by selecting a ClassVolumeConfig object.
