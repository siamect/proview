!  @Group Volumes
!  A dynamic volume only exist in runtime, and contains objects that are
!  created and deleted in runtime.
!
!  A dynamic volume is configured by a CreateVolume object, normally
!  positioned in the node hierarchy. It is not configured in the
!  directory volume.
!
!  The volume can be mounted in the root volume with a MountObject 
!  object.
!
!  The volume has to be registred in the global volume list, and is
!  identified by a volume identity.
