SObject pwrs:Class
!/**
!  @Group ClassDefinition
!  Root of a menu description tree.
!  Positioned in a classvolume under a $ClassDef object. The object
!  can have $MenuButton, $MenuCascade and $MenuSeparator objects as
!  children.
!
!  A $Menu object defines a popup menu in the development environment.
!  The name of the object specifies the function. The first part
!  states the utility of the menu, e.g Navigator, Configurator, the 
!  last five characters states the combination of the currently pointed 
!  and selected objects, for which the menu is valid:
!  1. 'Px' states what kind of item the cursur is pointing at, where x
!     can be: 'o' an object, 'a' an attribute or 'c' a class in a
!     palette.
!  2. 'sx' states what kind of item is currently selected, where x can
!     be: 'o' an object, 'a' an attribute, 'c' a class, 'm' many objects
!     or 'n' no selected object.
!  3. the last character states if the pointed and the selected object is
!     the same object 's', or not 'n'.
!
!  @b Example
!  NavigatorPosos: Popup menu in the navigator, when the cursor points at
!  an object that is selected.
!
!  ConfiguratorPoson: Popup menu in the configurator, when the cursor
!  points at an object, and another object is selected.
!
!  The menu items are configured with $MenuButton objects.
