!/**
!  @Group Volumes
!  Sub volume as an additional volume that, together with the root
!  volume is loaded into a node at system startup.
!
!  Sometimes it is convenient to separate the objects of a node into
!  two (or more) volumes, for example if a part of the plant is to be
!  moved to another node later, or if there are several developers that
!  has to work in different databases. It is then possible to devide the
!  objects of a node into a rootvolume, and a subvolume (or several 
!  subvolumes). 
!
!  The subvolumes is mounted in the rootvolume with a MountObject. Make
!  sure to find a suitable mouning point in the root volume. If the
!  subvolumes should be mounted on remote nodes, e.g. on an operator
!  station, the mounting point should not be hidden in the object tree
!  of the root volume.
!
!  In one qcom bus, a subvolume can only be loaded into one single node.
!
!  The volume has to be registred in the global volume list, and is
!  identified by a volume identity.
!  
!  In the directory volume of a project, a sub volume is configured
!  by a SubVolumeConfig object, and the node the volume is to be
!  loaded into is specified with a SubVolumeLoad object.
