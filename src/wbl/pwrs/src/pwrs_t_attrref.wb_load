!  Basic type attribute reference.
!  Reference to an attribute in an object. 
!
!  The reference contains
!    - objid of the referenced object
!    - classid of body
!    - offset of the attribute
!    - size of the attribute
!    - a flagword. If the bit Indirect is set, the attribute is a pointer.
!
!  The string notation for an attrref is 
!  _A<vid>:<oix>(<classvolume>:<class>).<attribute>[index], e.g.
!  _A0.123.34.63:1234567890(pwrb:Ai).FilterAttribute[2]
!
!  or if the class is unknown, the notation is
!  _A<vid>:<oix>(<cid>).(<bix>)<offset>.<size>, e.g.
!  _A0.123.34.63.1234567890(_C0.1:34).(_B1)60.34
!
!  where
!    vid is the volume id for the object.
!    oix is the object index for the object.
!    cid is classid for the class of the object.
!    bix is body index for the body of the attribute.
