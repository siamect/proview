SObject pwrs:Class
!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  @Group NodeConfiguration
!  Top and grouping object that helps to form structures
!  in the Node Hierarchy in the Node Configuration.
!  
!  A ProviewR system can have several $NodeHier objects
!  placed on the top level or below another $NodeHier
!  object.
!  
!  The object is used at the Node Configuration in a way
!  analog to the $PlantHier object in the Plant
!  Configuration. The advantage in using the object is not
!  always obvious. One way in a ProviewR system with
!  several nodes is to collect operator and process
!  stations below separate $NodeHier objects.
!  Is created in the development environment by means of
!  the Configuration Editor.
!  
!  Contains no relevant information (=data) in rtdb.
!  If, for the current node, no instance by the class
!  $NodeHier with the name $Orphange exist, it will be
!  created at 'Create Load Files ...'. This is the
!  background:
!  
!  In the target environment it is possible to create
!  objects dynamically. This may be done from application
!  programs by call to the system routine
!  gdh_CreateObject(...). Created objects have always to
!  be put below a parent object, i.e. they cannot exist on
!  the root level. If such an parent object is deleted at
!  program changing, the dynamically created objects below
!  it, would not be accessible any longer. Therefor
!  ProviewR will put such objects below $Orphange.
