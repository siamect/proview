!/**
!  @Group Volumes
!  Volume shared by several nodes.
!
!  A SharedVolume can be loaded into several nodes. Objects that is
!  common for several nodes, e.g. XttGraph objects or Sound objects, 
!  can be placed in a shared volume.
!
!  The volume has to be registred in the global volume list, and is
!  identified by a volume identity.
!  
!  In the directory volume of a project, a shard volume is configured
!  by a SharedVolumeConfig object, and the node (or nodes) the volume 
!  is to be loaded into is specified with a SharedVolumeLoad object.
