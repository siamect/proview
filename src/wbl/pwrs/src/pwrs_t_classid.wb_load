!  Class identity. Basic type.
!
!  Every class has a unique identity, derived from the classvolume
!  identity and the class index.
!
!  A class is described by classdefinition objects in a class volume. These
!  objects has specific object identities, which is specified by the vid, cix,
!  bix and aix.
!  @image orm_classid_1.gif
!  The figure above describes an objid for classdefinition objects. The black fields
!  must have the values specified in the figure, the gray fields are reserved
!  for future use.
! @b vid
!  The volume identity of the class volume where the class i defined. Only the
!  two lower entities of the volume identity can be used.
! @b cix
!  The index of the class within the class volume. The cix consists of 12 bits
!  which implies that the a class can have an index in the interval [1,4095].
! @b bix
!  The index of a body within a class.
!    0     The class itself, i.e. the ClassDef object).
!    1     RtBody or SysBody.
!    2     DevBody.
!    3-6   Reserved for future use.
!    7     Template object.
! @b aix
!  Index for an attribute within a body. The aix consists of 12 bits, which
!  implies that each body in a class can have attributes with index in the 
!  interval [1,4095]
!
! @b ClassId
!  The classid is a 32-bit reduction of the 64-bit object identity of the 
!  ClassDef object for the class. It contains the vid and the cix of the class.
!  @image orm_classid_2.gif
!
! @b c-binding
!  The classid is defined with a #define statement of type pwr_cClass_<class name>
!  in the struct file for the class and the classvolume.
!  System classes also has an enum pwr_eClass_<class name> declared in pwr_class.h
