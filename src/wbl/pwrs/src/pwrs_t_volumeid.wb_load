!  Volume identity. Basic type.
!
!  Every volume has a unique identity, a 32-bit word usually specified in the form
!  v1.v2.v3.v4 where v1, v2, v3 and v4 are numbers in the interval 0-255.
!  Dependent of the class of the volume, the numbers is choosen in separate
!  intervals:
!
!     RootVolume,SubVolume:       0.  1-254.  1-254.  1-254
!     System ClassVolumes:        0.      0.    0-1.  1-254
!     User ClassVolumes:          0.      0.  2-249.  1-254
!     Manufacturer ClassVolumes:  0.      0.250-254.  1-254
!     DirectoryVolume:          254.    254.    254.    253
!     WorkbenchVolume:          254.    254.    254.    254
!     Local WorkbenchVolume:    254.    254.    254.    252
!     VolatileVolume:           254.    254.    254.  0-100
!
!     Runtime:                1-253.       .       .  
!
!  In runtime 1-127 are used for system volumes
!     1    pwrNode    Volume used by ProviewR.
!
!  128-253 are used to create unique identities:
!     128  Subid
!     129  Dlid
!
!  The string notation for a volumeid is _Vv1.v2.v3.v4, e.g. _V0.0.1.4
