!/**
!  @Version 1.0
!  Grouping object used by 'documents'.
!  
!  Different types of objects used to make
!  'documentations' are supposed to be arranged below this
!  object. Neither $DocHier object nor objects that
!  includes in the hierarchy will be included in the
!  target environment.
!  
!  The object may not be configured on the top level.
!  
!      Hints
!  
!  It is suitable, but not necessary, to gather
!  ListDescriptor objects e.g. below a $DocHier object.
!  The ProviewR distribution is delivered with
!  pre-configured ListDescriptor objects (structures) to
!  perform standard lists. They are found in the Node
!  Configuration below the hierarchy Layout-Lists and
!  'Lists' is just by the class $DocHier object.
!  If a new type of list is to be defined or an existing
!  list is to be modified this is done by means of
!  ListDescriptor objects located below an object named
!  'Lists'. 'Lists' ought to be by the class $DocHier and
!  be configured in the workbench volume.
